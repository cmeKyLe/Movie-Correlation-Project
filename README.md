# Data Analysis Project – Python
Author: Khant Min Thaw
Project Type: Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Correlation Study
Status: Completed


# Overview
This project explores the relationships between various attributes in a dataset of movies, such as budget, gross revenue, and ratings. The analysis was conducted using Python to clean the data, perform exploratory analysis, and visualize correlations between key variables. The goal was to uncover patterns and insights that might inform decisions in the film industry or similar domains.


# Project Objectives
- Import, inspect, and understand a real-world movie dataset.
- Clean and prepare the data for accurate analysis.
- Identify missing values, handle data types, and remove irrelevant entries.
- Perform correlation analysis to understand relationships between variables.
- Visualize key insights using scatter plots and heatmaps.

# Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Pandas – for data manipulation
- NumPy – for numerical calculations
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – for visualization
- Jupyter Notebook – for interactive development

# What I Learned
- Through this project, I strengthened my foundational data analysis skills and learned several key practices:
- **Data Cleaning Is Critical**: Cleaning data is a necessary first step to avoid misinterpretation. I ensured that all values were consistent and relevant before moving forward.
- **Identifying Missing Values & Code Validation**: I used built-in methods to locate missing data and ensured the analysis code was reliable and reproducible.
- **Understanding the Data and the Goal**: Taking time to understand the structure and context of the dataset helped me make informed decisions during the analysis.
- **Recognizing Patterns**: By analyzing correlations, I was able to identify significant relationships, such as how a movie’s budget tends to relate to its gross revenue.
